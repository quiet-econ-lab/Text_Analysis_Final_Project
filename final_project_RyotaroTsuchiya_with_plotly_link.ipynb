        "The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book is a qualitative summary of business conditions based on reports from firms, industry contacts, and organizations across the twelve Federal Reserve districts. Released roughly two weeks before each FOMC meeting, it provides timely descriptions of hiring, prices, wages, and demand that often detect turning points earlier than standard macroeconomic indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite its importance, the Beige Book is entirely narrative. Policymakers must rely on subjective judgment to determine whether conditions are improving or weakening, which limits its usefulness for empirical analysis. This project examines whether the Beige Book’s tone can be quantified using sentence-level sentiment analysis, and whether such a measure tracks real economic activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "To investigate this, I scraped the full Beige Book archive, applied sentiment analysis to each sentence, constructed a monthly sentiment index, and compared it with the Philadelphia Fed’s Coincident Economic Activity Index. I also used TF-IDF to identify themes that drive positive and negative sentiment over time.\n"

When a release is detected, the scraper collects the publication date, the regional section name, and the full narrative text. The resulting dataset contains several thousand district-level narratives describing business conditions across more than five decades."

        "The Beige Book narratives were cleaned by standardizing whitespace and removing formatting inconsistencies. Each cleaned document was then split into individual sentences. This step was essential because many paragraphs include both positive and negative assessments, and sentence-level granularity ensures that sentiment is measured precisely rather than averaged across mixed passages. These sentences form the core dataset for the sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "To prepare text for identifying economic themes, a second cleaned version of each sentence was created specifically for TF-IDF. Based on the cleaning script in [Krisel (2023)](https://github.com/rskrisel/tfidf_topic_modeling/blob/main/Intro_Text_Analysis_TFIDF_LDA_Inaugurals.ipynb), this process included lowercasing, tokenization, and removal of English stopwords, years, month names, and common Beige Book terms such as “contacts” or “reported.” The purpose was to retain economically meaningful vocabulary while filtering out boilerplate phrasing that appears in nearly every report. The resulting tokenized sentences were then ready for TF-IDF modeling."

              "2373  General economic conditions have held firm in the Ninth District. Employment demand has remained high, and consumer spending has continued to grow moderately. Recent rains should eventually help some drought-stricken crop, livestock, and dairy operations. And agricultural bank conditions, while not improving, have not yet deteriorated either. Labor Markets The most recent statistics indicate that district labor markets have experienced some additional tightening. During May, Minnesota's unemployment rate dropped to 3.2 percent, its lowest level in 9 years. The unemployment rate in its Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area fell to just 2.8 percent. In that area, temporary help agencies report some spot labor shortages and rising wages paid to clerical workers. Both the labor force and total employment reached record highs during May in South Dakota; its unemployment rate was only 3 percent. Also, North Dakota's unemployment rate dropped to 3.7 percent during May, almost one full percentage point below its level a year earlier. During past years, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has experienced very high unemployment; this has eased in the 12 months ending in May: from 10.6 to 7.7 percent. Consumer Spending Retail spending has continued to grow moderately in the district. One chain reports that its department store sales were 7 percent higher this June than last. One chain plans to significantly expand two of its stores in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area. A chain with stores throughout the district reports much stronger growth during this period, but a higher market share probably accounts for much of that strength. Neither chain reports any inventory or credit problems. District sales of motor vehicles have continued to hold up well. One domestic manufacturer reports that its car sales during June rose 17 percent over their level a year earlier. A district manager for a popular domestic line reports that car sales during June were strong at virtually all its dealers. A recent arena sale in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, went quite well. But district truck sales have slowed relative to car sales, perhaps due to drought-induced buying resistance in farm-dependent areas. Still, vehicle inventories haven't risen above normal levels. Housing activity has held firm. Home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area during May and June were 13 percent ahead of a year earlier. Residential building contracts In Minnesota were up 5 percent during May. But as has been true for some time, housing activity was stagnant in many cities and towns of Montana and North Dakota. District tourist spending has increased sharply this summer. Despite burning bans at campgrounds, all tourism industry representatives contacted report increased activity. For example, Independence Day weekend business was way above the expectations of industry sources in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. A source in northern Wisconsin says that tourism there has beers running 10 percent ahead of last year. And the Black Hills area of South Dakota has also done well. Agriculture Rain during July came too late to significantly help some of the district's wheat, barley, and oats crops but has helped its soybean and corn crops. For example, during the third week in July, the Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture estimated that 80 percent of' Minnesota's soybean crop would survive. Soybeans are Minnesota's second-largest cash crop. Its largest crop, corn, is not expected to do so well: only 60 percent may survive. Crop insurance will help district farmers cover part of the lost output. Compared to last year, federally sponsored multiperil coverage is up 83 percent in South Dakota, 77 percent in North Dakota, 41 percent in Montana, and 31 percent in Minnesota. More help has come from prices of farm products, which have continued to rise. Mid-July products of corn and soybeans on the cash markets were over 70 percent higher than a year earlier, while barley and wheat prices were up around 50 percent. These high prices imply lower government deficiency payments to farmers under current law, but some form of disaster relief might be enacted to replace that loss. Furthermore, farmers with stored crops carried over from last year will benefit from sales at these high prices. Livestock and dairy operations have been significantly hampered by higher feed prices and a shortage of pasture growth. As a result, more stock has been sold than normal, which has lowered its price as much as 20 percent. Recent rains should help stimulate grass growth, though, and slow the sell-off in some parts of the district. Financial Conditions The safety and soundness of district banks do not seem to have been hurt by the drought yet. Members of this Bank's Advisory Council on Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor report that banks are still liquid and looking for good lending opportunities. A prominent banker in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, says that most serious farm debt problems won't be noticed until next year. This Bank's latest survey of district agricultural bankers does indicate that many bankers are expecting low farm income and slow repayment of farm debt during the third quarter. Still, the condition of district agricultural banks substantially improved during 1987, which should help them weather the drought.  "

        "To understand what drives movements in sentiment, I applied TF-IDF separately to positive and negative sentences for each monthly release. TF-IDF ranks words by how distinctive they are within that month relative to the entire corpus. This approach highlights the economic concepts that businesses emphasized most strongly in positive or negative reports. By examining these terms over time, it is possible to identify shifts in the themes that shape business sentiment, such as supply-chain issues, labor concerns, or demand conditions."

        "When the Beige Book Sentiment Index is compared with the growth rate of the Philadelphia Fed’s Coincident Economic Activity Index, the two measures tend to move in a similar direction. Periods of stronger sentiment are generally associated with stronger underlying economic conditions, whereas weaker sentiment coincides with slower growth. This alignment indicates that qualitative business narratives contain timely information about economic momentum—an insight that is particularly valuable during periods when official statistics are delayed or unavailable, as in the current government shutdown.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the graph above shows, the sentiment index has softened. The background for this decline becomes clearer when viewed alongside the TF-IDF results, which are accessible through the hover labels in the plot. In particular, the decline in May 2025 stands out. The most prominent negative terms for that month— “demand,” “uncertain,” and “tariff”—indicate increasing concerns about slowing demand and uncertainty related to trade policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "A similar pattern is visible in November 2025, where negative sentences again emphasize “demand” and “uncertain.” This persistence indicates that caution among businesses has not eased and that uncertainty remains a major factor shaping economic expectations. In addition, “labor” appears as an important negative term. Given the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, the emergence of “labor” as a source of concern carries meaningful implications for monetary policy, as discussed in the next section."

        "## 6. Policy Implications and Conclusion\n",
        "For monetary policymakers, a decline in Beige Book sentiment driven by weakening demand and heightened uncertainty provides an early signal of economic slowing. Such developments strengthen the case for policy easing. As noted above, concerns about the labor market are particularly important. When negative terms related to “labor” appear alongside broader signs of weakening demand, they suggest that the Federal Reserve’s goal of maximum employment may be at risk, creating a strong signal in favor of lowering interest rates. Indeed, the Federal Reserve has recently decided to cut rates, consistent with the deterioration in sentiment documented in the Beige Book.\n",
        "\n",
        "For fiscal policymakers, the economic themes revealed through the TF-IDF analysis are especially valuable because fiscal policy, unlike monetary policy, can be targeted toward specific sectors or groups. For example, if “tariff” appears as a prominent negative term, this indicates that importers facing higher input costs and consumers affected by price pass-through may require targeted relief. In addition, the TF-IDF results for November 2025 show manufacturing among the positive keywords, suggesting that this sector remains relatively resilient. In such circumstances, the analysis also helps clarify how to finance targeted support. If manufacturing is performing comparatively well while importers and consumers are under strain, redistributing income from the stronger sector to those more adversely affected may represent an appropriate fiscal strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this project demonstrates that the Federal Reserve’s qualitative Beige Book can be transformed into a useful numerical indicator through sentence-level sentiment analysis. The resulting index aligns with real economic activity, and the TF-IDF results help reveal the economic themes that drive month-to-month shifts in sentiment. Together, these methods show that narrative economic information—often viewed as anecdotal or subjective—can be converted into data that meaningfully informs monetary and fiscal decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several extensions could further enhance the value of this approach. Applying the same methodology at the district level could highlight regional strengths and challenges, enabling not only the Federal Reserve and federal policymakers but also state and local governments to incorporate these insights into their policy processes. Although the smaller volume of text in district-level reports may increase the volatility of sentiment indices, this limitation could be mitigated by using FinBERT, a language model trained specifically on financial and economic text. While VADER was used in this project for its speed and low computational cost, FinBERT may offer more accurate and less volatile sentiment classification, especially when GPU-based parallel processing is available. With such refinements, the Beige Book could become an even more powerful quantitative resource for real-time economic monitoring and policy design."
